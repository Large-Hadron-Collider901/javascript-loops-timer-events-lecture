# JavaScript Loops and Timer Events Lecture

### While/For Loop Practice 1:
- Create an empty `name_array`
- Ask the user ```Enter a word. Enter 'q' to quit.``` Add each word they enter to the array
- Create a while loop that will keep asking for words to add to the array until they enter 'q'
- When the user enters 'q' use a **for** loop to print each word from the array
- NOTE: Your code should handle the case of the entered quit letter `Q`

## Timer Practice 1: One off timer
Write the JavaScript code to display `BREAK OFF THE ATTACK! Their shields are still up!` then after 3 seconds (3000 ms) in the console display `IT'S A TRAP!` using a one off timer.

## Timer Practice 2: Repeating timer
Write the HTML code so that you have one button that says `Hush Ya'll`. Write the JavaScript code to nag the user every 5 seconds with a message of `Well... We're waiting!!!` until you click the button. Clicking the button will stop the nage messages in the console.
